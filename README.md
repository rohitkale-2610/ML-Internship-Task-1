Linear Regression on California Housing Dataset – ML Internship Task 1
# ML Internship Task 1 – Linear Regression

## Objective
To build a Linear Regression model to predict house prices using the California Housing dataset.

## Dataset
California Housing Dataset from scikit-learn.

## Steps Performed
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Train-test split
- Linear Regression model training
- Model evaluation using MAE, MSE, and R² score

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Result
The model successfully predicts house prices and explains a significant portion of variance in the data.
